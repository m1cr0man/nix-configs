# All

Extrusion Mult 0.97

# 40mm/s

- Pressure Advance ~1.2

# 80mm/s

- Pressure Advance ~0.8

# 120mm/s

- Pressure advance somewhere between .6 and .8
  - < .6 was definitely over extruding at corners
  - .7 wasn't too bad
  - I would say .65

# TODO

- Tune benchy chimney

## More tuning

1500m/s accel seemed to do the trick
